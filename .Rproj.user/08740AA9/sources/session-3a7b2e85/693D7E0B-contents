# Method

To do:

-   Improve reporting. Instead of skipping, should recreate the messages
    of the cached tests whilst also making it clear that these have been
    skipped

`test_that_cached()` is a drop-in replacement for
`testthat::test_that()`:

-   The first time a test with caching gets run, it creates a file in
    `tests/testthat/_cache/` to indicate which functions get called,
    directly or indirectly, during the test

-   When the test is called subsequently, if any of the functions which
    get called have changed in terms of their definition, the cache is
    invalidated and the test is re-run. The cache is also invalidated if
    the code for the test itself has changed.

    -   This is checked by
