#' Test reporter: interactive progress bar of errors.
#'
#' @description
#' `CacheReporter` is designed for interactive use. Its goal is to
#' give you actionable insights to help you understand the status of your
#' code. This reporter also praises you from time-to-time if all your tests
#' pass. It's the default reporter for [test_dir()].
#'
#' `ParallelProgressReporter` is very similar to `ProgressReporter`, but
#' works better for packages that want parallel tests.
#'
#' `CompactProgressReporter` is a minimal version of `ProgressReporter`
#' designed for use with single files. It's the default reporter for
#' [test_file()].
